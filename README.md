# Summer_ML_Internship

1. Project Overview
Project Title: CONFSEC Project - Threat Detection Module
Description: This project aims to develop a threat detection module that identifies and flags inappropriate content during virtual meetings. The module utilizes various AI and ML techniques to detect potential threats, including hate speech, racial profiling, gender discrimination, and more.

2. Machine Learning and AI Modules
Expression Detection: Implemented a system to record and analyze facial expressions, flagging meetings based on predefined company policies.
Racial Profiling Detection: Created modules to detect racial comments or discriminatory language in both verbal and textual forms.
Sexting and Inappropriate Content Detection: Developed a mechanism to identify and flag sexting or inappropriate content shared during meetings, including a list of keywords and patterns.
Hate Speech and Threat Detection: Utilized sentiment analysis and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify and flag hate speech and threats.
3. Data Preparation and Processing
Tokenization and POS Tagging: Implemented tokenization using NLTK and part-of-speech (POS) tagging using SpaCy.
Sentiment Analysis: Employed the NLTK Vader sentiment analysis tool to evaluate the sentiment of the text.
Data Splitting and Preprocessing: Split the dataset into training and testing sets and preprocessed the data for model training.
4. Model Training and Evaluation
Model Used: DistilBERT (distilbert-base-uncased) for sequence classification.
Training Configuration: Set up training arguments including learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.
Custom Trainer: Created a custom Trainer class to handle weighted loss computation for class imbalance.
Evaluation Metrics: Computed accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for model evaluation.
5. Technical Implementations
Libraries Used: transformers, datasets, nltk, spacy, torch.
Threat Analysis Function: Developed a function to analyze text for potential threats using tokenization, POS tagging, sentiment analysis, and model prediction.
6. Documentation and Presentation
GitHub Repository: Include all the code, datasets, and documentation in your GitHub repository. Make sure to provide clear README files explaining each module and how to use them.
Sample Outputs: Share examples of flagged content and explain the decision-making process of the model.
7. Future Work and Improvements
Expand Dataset: Suggest adding more diverse and extensive datasets to improve the model's accuracy and robustness.
Fine-Tuning: Mention potential fine-tuning of the model for specific company policies or additional languages.
UI/UX Integration: Discuss plans for integrating the model with a user-friendly interface for real-time monitoring and reporting.
